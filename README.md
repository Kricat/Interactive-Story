# Interactive-Story
Yes/No interactive story using Prolog

In order for the project to function properly, you must consult the .pl files in this order:
# (1) fig15_11_mod.pl
# (2) project.pl
# (3) fig15_7_mod_1.6.2017

To start the story, enter "story."

There are many different endings. Be sure to restart the Prolog environment to unlock the other endings or just retract all the facts.
